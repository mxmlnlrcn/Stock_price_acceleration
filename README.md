Measure the asset's price acceleration 

In this short notebook I was tryng to identify a curve that descrived the movement of the price of an asset to deduce the aceleration of the price. Because if you percive a change in the aceleration of the price you may anticipate a change in the asset's velocity that leads you to atincipate a change in the direction of the price. that would help to indetify an investment strategy
